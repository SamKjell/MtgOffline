# MtgOffline
MtgOffline is one of my hobby projects. It's an application which can pit a digital Magic: The Gathering bot against a tabletop player. The name is a spoof on Mtg Online, an official magic tabletop simulator. However, I always wanted to play the game with my own physical paper cards on my table against an online opponent or a computer bot (this was during the pandemic so I couldn't get regular games in), so I created MtgOffline to do just that.

# Src
The src folder contains samples of most of the code. This code will likely not compile out of the box since it is missing the resources and dependencies that are setup in my development environment. If you are interested in taking a look at this program in action, see the next section! I will also note that this project is something I have worked on in an on and off fashion over the last few years, and that being said, is probably very messy and has poor documentation.  

# Release
This project is just a hobby project, so it hasn't historically worked out of the box and is missing a few features such as a proper installer. That being said, I would like to enable prospective employers (or any interested party for that matter) the opportunity to run the program for themselves. So, I have created a release folder which should be able to be downloaded and run on a Windows machine right out of the box. To do so, download the project, unzip it, and double click MtgOffline.exe to run the project. If you have any issues please leave a comment and I will try to resolve it!
