# MtgOffline
MtgOffline is one of my hobby projects. It's an application which can pit a digital Magic: The Gathering bot against a tabletop player. The name is a spoof on Mtg Online, an official magic tabletop simulator. However, I always wanted to play the game with my own physical paper cards on my table against an online opponent or a computer bot (this was during the pandemic so I couldn't get regular games in), so I created MtgOffline to do just that.

# Src
The src folder contains samples of most of the code. This code will likely not compile out of the box since it is missing the resources and dependencies that are setup in my development environment. If you are interested in taking a look at this program in action, see the next section! 

# Demo
I have uploaded a demo video showing the basic features of the program in action.
